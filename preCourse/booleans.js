Challenges
Use the comparison operators (==, ===, <, >, <=, >=) to log a few statements to the console to see if they are true or false. Try a mix of comparing numbers and strings to each other.


// ADD CODE HERE

let likesJavaScript = true;
let likesMath = false;

const numberToCheck = 10;
console.log(numberToCheck === 10)

console.log(numberToCheck <= 10)
console.log(numberToCheck > 10)
