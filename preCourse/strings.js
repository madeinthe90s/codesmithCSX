Strings are a datatype in JavaScript. In short, they are any bit of text that's wrapped in quotes. You can use either single quotes, double quotes, or backticks - as long as the opening and closing symbols for the string match. They are particularly useful for any data or values that can be represented as plain text.

Challenge
Create a variable named myString whose value is a string, and print it to the console. 


var myString = ''

 console.log('string');
 console.log("string");
