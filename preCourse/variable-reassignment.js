1. Now that we know what variables are, let's create on of our own. Create a variable named lastName and assign it a value of your last name. Make sure you wrap your name in quotation marks ".

/* Challenge 1 */


 console.log("Hi, " + firstName + " " + lastName);

2. You can update variables as well. Look at the example below and notice how the value assigned to name changes.

Now, update the value of firstName to be your firstName. Run your code, you should see the word Jenny replaced by your name.


/* Challenge 2 */


 console.log("Hi, " + firstName + " " + lastName);
